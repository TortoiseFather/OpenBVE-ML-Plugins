# OpenBVE-ML-Plugins
A series of data collection listeners and ML processes for OpenBVE. I might make documentation if I'm not lazy.

OpenBVE https://openbve-project.net/ is an open source railway simulator.
These plugins are made for version 1.11.0.3.
They are built for the DMU Class 220 however have been tested on BR_C37-416 and Voyager-1, ll tested on the MF 1728 NCL-Berwick route.

Built with purpose of fitting SACRED methodology for purpose of Computer Science PhD. Also built for fun :)

Unfortunately I cannot share .train files or railway signal packages.

This project is unofficial and not endorsed by Christopher Lees. If this goes against the OpenBVE policy let me know and I'll take this down. I just found developing for InterfaceQuickReference a pain as I was unable to find documentation.
The 'documentation can be found within /examples folder' doesn't work, my copy of BVE did not come with an examples folder.
